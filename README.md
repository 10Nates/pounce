Snake except it's nothing like snake and it's a completely different game altogether!

Catch your prey as they get progressively more evasive and 
your metabolism gets progressively faster. Make sure to
stay precise! It takes energy to pounce.

> Move selection:     WASD
> 
> Pounce:             Space or G

> Menu:               ESC

> Exit:               Ctrl+C or Q

## Compiling & Running

Pounce is a very simple game. As such, it's very easy to compile. However, it does require Go to be installed.

```
go build pounce.go
```

Go will then create an executable for your system that can usually just be clicked on. It can also be run in command line as you would normally.
> *When running in command line, use `./pounce debug` for a debug screen in the top left*
